.. _first step:

Okay, time to run some code! Now we will check the tools we need, create a project
with one executable, then build and run it. Try to follow instructions
**accurately**. The goal of this section is to run the simplest configuration with
commonly/widely used tools. After you've checked that everything is fine and
feel comfortable you can find more options in:
:doc:`platforms`, :doc:`generators` and :doc:`compilers`.
Each command's usage/pitfalls will be described in depth further in :ref:`Tutorials <Tutorials>`.
