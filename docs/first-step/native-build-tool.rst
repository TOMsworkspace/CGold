Native build tool
=================

As already mentioned CMake is **not designed** to do the build itself -
it :ref:`generates files <cmake generate native build tool>`
which can be used by a real :ref:`native build tool <Native build tool>`,
hence you need to choose such a
tool(s) and install it if needed. Option `-G \<generator-name>`_ can be used to
specify what type of generator will be used. If no such option present CMake
will use default generator (e.g. ``Unix Makefiles`` on \*nix platforms).

The list of available `generators`_ depends on the host OS (e.g. ``Visual Studio``
family generators are not available on ``Linux``). You can get this list by running
``cmake --help``:

.. code-block:: none

  > cmake --help
  ...
  Generators

  The following generators are available on this platform:
    Unix Makefiles              = Generates standard UNIX makefiles.
    Ninja                       = Generates build.ninja files (experimental).
    Watcom WMake                = Generates Watcom WMake makefiles.
    CodeBlocks - Ninja          = Generates CodeBlocks project files.
    ...
